      <h2 id="1" style="color: #1496d3">What is COVID-19?</h2>
      <p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.</p>

      <h2 id="2" style="color: #1496d3">How is it Transmitted?</h2>
      <p>COVID-19 is spread through airborne transmission, particularly when the infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets contaminate other people, objects and surfaces within the vicinity of the infected person. When other people touch these objects or surfaces, they transfer the virus to themselves when they touch their face, particularly the eyes, nose or mouth.<br><br> Social distancing of a meter away from an infected person is key to preventing infection. The virus has been found to survive on surfaces for several hours, even up to several days. Therefore, practicing frequent handwashing upon coming into contact with these surfaces, i.e., door handles, railings, elevator buttons, etc. may help to prevent yourself from getting the virus.<br> <br> Your cellphone, money and keyboards can inadvertently carry the virus if you’ve come into contact with the virus from one of these carrier surfaces. Disinfect them often.</p>

      <div class="card" style="padding: 30px">
      <h2 id="3" style="color: #1496d3">What are the symptoms?</h2>
      <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are: <li>Fever</li><li>Dry cough</li><li>Fatigue</li><br> Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include:<li>Loss of taste or smell,</li><li>Nasal congestion,</li><li>Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes)</li><li>Sore throat,</li><li>Headache,</li><li>Muscle or joint pain,</li><li>Different types of skin rash,</li><li>Nausea or vomiting,</li><li>Diarrhea,</li><li>Chills or dizziness.</li> <br>Symptoms of severe COVID‐19 disease include:<li>High temperature (above 38 °C).</li><li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest,</li><li>Confusion,</li><li>Loss of appetite,</li><li>Shortness of breat</li> <br>Other less common symptoms are: ><li>Dry cough</li><li>Fatigue</li><br> Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include:<li>Irritability,</li><li>Reduced consciousness (sometimes associated with seizures),</li><li>Anxiety,</li><li>Depression,</li><li>Sleep disorders,</li><li>More severe and rare neurological complications such as strokes, brain inflammation, delirium and nerve damage. People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical care immediately. If possible, call your health care provider, hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic.</li> <br>For symptomatic patients, the time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available. Asymptomatic patients do not show symptom(but they have the virus).</p>

      <h2 id="4" style="color: #1496d3;">What happens to people who get COVID-19?</h2>
      <p>Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.<br><br>Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.<br><br>In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.</p>

      <h2 id="5" style="color: #1496d3;">Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?</h2>
      <p>People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.<br><br>However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.</p>

      <div><img src="extra.jpg" class="fakeimg" style="height:370px;"></div>

      <h2 id="6" style="color: #1496d3;">How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</h2>
      <p>Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!</p>

      <h2 id="7" style="color: #1496d3;">When should I get a test for COVID-19?</h2>
      <p>Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.<br><br> While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities.</p>

      <h2 id="8" style="color: #1496d3;">Are there vaccines or treatments for COVID-19?</h2>
      <p>No, there are no treatments available. Scientists around the world are still working to find and develop treatments for the virus. However, currently several COVID-19 vaccines are in clinical trials with over 50 vaccine candidates. <br><br> WHO is working in collaboration with scientists, business, and global health organizations through the ACT Accelerator to speed up the pandemic response. When a safe and effective vaccine is found, COVAX (led by WHO, GAVI and CEPI) will facilitate the equitable access and distribution of these vaccines to protect people in all countries. People most at risk will be prioritized.<br><br><i style="color: gray"> "While we work towards rolling out a safe and effective vaccine fairly, we must continue the essential public health actions to suppress transmission and reduce mortality."</i> - WHO</p>      

      <h2 id="9" style="color: #1496d3">What to do if you start to develop COVID-19 symptoms</h2>
      <p>If you think you have symptoms of COVID-19, it’s important to take the following steps:<li>Stay home. By staying home, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others in your community. Plan to only go out if you need to seek medical care.</li><li> Separate yourself from others. If you share your home with others, distance yourself from them as much as possible. Try to use a bedroom and bathroom that’s separate from the rest of your household.</li><li>Call your doctor. It’s important to let your doctor or healthcare provider know about your symptoms. They may ask you questions about when and how you may have been exposed. Try to answer these to the best of your ability.
      </li><li>Follow your doctor’s instructions. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to care for yourself while you’re ill. They may also arrange for you to be tested for COVID-19 if you haven’t been tested already.</li><li>Monitor your symptoms. Keep track of your symptoms and if they begin to worsen, don’t hesitate to get medical attention. Plan to call ahead before you arrive at your doctor’s office, an urgent care facility, or an emergency room.</li></p>
